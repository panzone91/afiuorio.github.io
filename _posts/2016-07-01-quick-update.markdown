As I said in the previous post, last week was the GSOC evaluation week. I've passed my evaluation and I can continue this journey.<!--more-->

This week I don't have a real update. Except for correcting a couple of problems that my patch generated (thanks PGI compiler for being this much pedantic about standards), I:

1. Couldn't continue with my next step because I have to be sure about the format of the stacktrace. I've asked on the Chapel mailing list the format developers think will be more useful but I had to wait some time for having enough opinions
2. I had some school-related work to finish (here we only have August as a free month)

Nothing interesting enough to write a blog post about. Let's see you next week.
