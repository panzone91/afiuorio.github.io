It's been a couple of years that I wanted to keep a little personal blog online. <!--more--> There are several reasons for that, like:

<ul>
<li>Improve my writing english</li>
<li>Have a clean site to use as an entry point for my portfolio</li>
<li>Have a place where record my little discoveries and explorations</li>
</ul>

However I've never found the will or the initiative to start one. However, this year I've been selected for the second time for the [Google Summer Of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and I want to keep a little blog about it, hoping that it can be helpful for anyone who wants to be selected in the future.
